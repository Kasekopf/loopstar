# Overview

This is a 1-day ascension script, using the [grimoire](https://github.com/Kasekopf/grimoire) framework. Supported paths at the moment are:

- Casual
- A Shrunken Adventurer am I

Moreover, this script can perform some loop-friendly tasks in aftercore (leveling up, or the steel organ quest) with the `goal` arg.

The script is designed to be run as part of a loop. In particular, it expects that something like [garbo](https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/garbage-collector) will use the rest of the turns. This means that some profitable daily resources (e.g. copiers) may be saved for aftercore, but most resources (free runaways, kills, some wanderers) are used to save turns where possible.

## Installation

To install the script, use the following command in the KoLMafia CLI.

```
git checkout https://github.com/Kasekopf/loopstar release
```

## Usage

1. In aftercore, run `loopstar sim` to verify that the script is installed, and to confirm that you meet the requirements. By default, the requirements will be listed to perform a "Casual" run. To view requirements for other paths, set the path argument like `loopstar sim path=smol`. See below for more details.
2. Ensure you satisfy the pre-run requirements for your desired run, listed below.
3. Ascend into your desired run, considering the recommendations below.
4. Run `loopstar` and watch it go! If you are more hesitant, you can run `loopstar actions 10` to only do 10 things and stop.

# Path-Specific Instructions

## Instructions for Casual

- Run `loopstar sim` to see requirements. Note that the required items listed are enough that the script will not crash, but _not_ necessarily enough to finish the run in one day.
- For safety, this script will not touch anything that is in your closet (with a few minor exceptions, e.g. `bowling ball`). If you want to be extra safe, you could closet most of your meat before running the script; 1mil of available meat should be more than enough (unlike `loop-casual`, this script will not automatically do this extra-meat closeting).
- Upon completion, the script will _not_ break the prism; you'll have to do that yourself.

Other Recommendations:

- Seal Clubber is the most tested class.
- Choose astral pilsners from The Deli Lama.
- Workshed will be set to `model train set` by default at the start of the run, but this can be changed with the `workshed` argument. The best workshed is probably `Asdon Martin keyfob (on ring)`. A `TakerSpace letter of Marque` is also a good option; in that case, see the `swapworkshed` arg as well.
- Consider the `stomach`, `liver`, and `spleen` arguments. The default values are designed for maximally green players. If you are missing items, you will probably want to increase these. If you run out of adventures during the run, you can increase these arguments and rerun.
- If you are running something like [philter](https://github.com/Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society/philter) or [keeping tabs](https://github.com/loathers/keeping-tabs), it may be worth checking that you are not autoselling anything that the script needs (or it will rebuy it every run). See [this file](src/paths/casual/acquire.ts) for a list.

## Instructions for Shrunken Adventurer

- Run `loopstar sim path=smol` to see requirements. Note that the required items listed are enough that the script will not crash, but _not_ necessarily enough to finish the run in one day. As a baseline, 2021-2023 standard set and all skill perms is certainly enough to finish in one day.
- **You must have a Pizza of Legend (or one of the other 2 legend foods) saved in Hagnk's Storage.** You will not be able to cook this item after ascending.

Other Recommendations:

- By default, the script will try and use an `Ol' Scratch's salad fork` and a `Frosty's frosty mug`. But these items are very expensive! Consider the `skipfork` and `skipmug` arguments, if you are very green.
- Seal Clubber is the most tested class.
- Choose astral pilsners from The Deli Lama.
- Astral mask or astral belt are both useful, but neither is required.
- Prefer candles for your eurdora.
- Workshed will be set to `model train set` by default at the start of the run, but this can be changed with the `workshed` argument. A `TakerSpace letter of Marque` is also a good option; in that case, see the `swapworkshed` arg as well.

# Options

Options can be changed in a few different ways:

- In the Mafia relay browser, select `loopstar` from the dropdown in the top right. Be sure to `Save Changes` after modifying a setting.
- By setting a mafia setting, e.g. `set loopstar_pulls=18`.
- By providing an argument at runtime, e.g. `loopstar pulls=18`. Note that any arguments provided at runtime override relay and mafia settings.

Run `loopstar help` for the full set of script commands and options:

```
> loopstar help

This is a script to complete runs in a single day for supported paths.

Run "loopstar sim" without quotes to check if this script will work for you in a casual run. You can also set the path option (for example "loopstar sim path=smol") to check with different supported paths.

The arguments accepted by the script are listed below. Note that you can combine multiple options; for example "loopstar pulls=18 fax=false" will save 2 pulls and avoid using a faxbot. Most options also have an associated setting to set an option permanently; for example "set loopstar_pulls=18" will cause the script to always save 2 pulls (unless overriden by using the pulls option at runtime).

# Will this script work for me?

Run `loopstar sim` to see "Is the script intended to work unmodified on my character?". By default, this will be for a "Casual" run; to view requirements for other paths, set the path argument like `loopstar sim path=smol`. See below for more details. A sample output is below, but it may be slightly out of date.

```
> loopstar sim

### Manual Installation

If you would like to make your own modifications to the script, the recommended way is to compile and install the script manually.

1. Compile the script, following instructions in the [kol-ts-starter](https://github.com/docrostov/kol-ts-starter).
2. Copy `loopstar.js` and `loopstar_choice.js` from `dist/KoLmafia/scripts/loopstar` to your Mafia scripts directory (or set up a symlink).
